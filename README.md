# Harry2166's Rubik's Cube Timer in SvelteKit
A Rubik's Cube time built in SvelteKit hosted in Vercel and Supabase. It uses Svelte's Flowbite component library for its frontend. 

This project is a Rubik's Cube timer that supports the following features:
- Login and Registration
- Keeping track of times for the 2x2, 3x3, and Skewb events
- Select a new scramble for a given puzzle
- Showing the state of the scrambles
- Showing the previously recorded times of each user
- Keep track of penalties that a solve may have incurred

This project is heavily inspired by <a href="https://cstimer.net">cstimer</a>.

## Getting Started
Visit the cube timer <a href="https://harry2166-cube-timer.vercel.app">here.</a>

In order to use the timer, you just have to press the spacebar **once** and it will immediately start the timer. In order to check all the solves that were done, visit your dashboard found on the upper right hand corner of the timer page. This is also the page where you also flag penalties related to the times.
